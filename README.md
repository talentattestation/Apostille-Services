<p>Moving  across countries is the dream of many nowadays, but the move is not as easy as  it seems. People need to go through a documentation procedure before using the  applicable documents in the traveling country. However, understanding the  documentation procedure and its requirements solely depends on, which country  you are traveling to. If the traveling country is a member of The Hague  Convention Agreement, an Apostille Attestation will be necessary, and if not, a  general attestation will be applicable.</p>
<h3> <strong>What is&nbsp;Apostille&nbsp;attestation?</strong></h3>

<p> An  Apostille attestation verifies the genuineness of the signature, seal, or stamp  on the document, thereby facilitating its recognition in member international  countries of the Hague Convention without the need for further legalization  from the Embassy or Consulate.&nbsp;</p>
